### Project Specification: Automated API Testing from Excel Scenarios

#### **Objective**
To automate the process of translating Excel-based scenario data into API calls and BDD specifications, enabling seamless integration with Jenkins for regular testing.

#### **Requirements**

1. **Input Handling**
   - Accept Excel files containing business operation names and structured data.
   - Use notes or comments in the first cell of each table to define table type (denormalized or related tables).
   - Map business operation names to API endpoints using vendor extensions in the OpenAPI spec.

2. **Data Structure Interpretation**
   - Support both denormalized tables and multiple related tables for nested data.
   - Indicate child tables within parent tables through specific column markers; link child tables back to parent columns.

3. **Column Name Mapping**
   - Maintain mappings between business column names (in Sentence Case) and technical column names using vendor extensions.
   - Default conversion from camelCase to Sentence Case if no mapping is found.

4. **Validation Mechanism**
   - Compare actual API responses against expected results defined in similar structured Excel tables.
   - Use notes/comments in the first cell of result tables for validation commands.

5. **Reporting & Feedback**
   - Generate summary reports detailing pass/fail status, discrepancies, and errors encountered during execution.
   
6. **Execution Environment**
    - Integrate with Jenkins 'Sanity pipeline' for automated execution as part of CI/CD workflow.

#### **Architecture Choices**

- Utilize OpenAPI Generator or Swagger Codegen to generate client libraries that can be extended for reading Excel files and making API requests.
- Implement a script that reads scenarios from Excel, generates test scripts based on OpenAPI spec definitions, integrates them into a BDD framework like Cucumber/Behave/SpecFlow without manual coding intervention beyond initial setup scripts.

#### **Data Handling Details**

- Use Apache POI (Java) or openpyxl (Python) libraries to parse Excel files programmatically.
- Ensure consistent interpretation of denormalized vs related table formats by checking indicators/comments in the first cell of each table.
  
#### **Error Handling Strategies**

- Implement logging mechanisms within generated code/scripts to capture errors during file parsing, request generation/execution, response validation stages—ensuring detailed logs are available for debugging purposes if needed post-execution via Jenkins reporting tools/plugins integration options provided natively therein too!

####  **Testing Plan**

1. Develop unit tests covering:
    - Parsing logic correctness
    - Accurate mapping between business operations & endpoints
    - Proper handling/conversion rules applied consistently across different input formats/scenarios

2. Conduct integration tests validating end-to-end functionality:
    a) Scenario translation accuracy
    b) Successful execution against live/staging environments where applicable

3 . Regularly review/update test cases/scenarios ensuring alignment with evolving requirements/specifications over time!
